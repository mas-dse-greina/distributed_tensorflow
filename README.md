# distributed_tensorflow
Sample Implementation of Distributed TensorFlow

This should work for TF > 1.4.

It implements either synchronous and asynchronous parameter updates.

The "data" is just a simple line with random noise. You can change the slope and intercept of the line by editing those variables at the top of the test_dist.py file.
